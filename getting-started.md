# Welcome :corn:
Welcome city boy! You aren't from around here, are ya? That's alright. We can use more hands on our farm. And soon you will be a seasoned farmer, just like the rest of us…with strong callused hands.

Before we get started, make sure you understand the [basics](/en/press) and the [risks](/en/faq) of farming.

All done? Alright! Let's get farming!
# What We're Gonna Do :tomato:
- To help reduce the risk of impermanent loss (you read the risks, right?), we'll start with a stablecoin, USDC.
- We will buy USDC on an exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance
- Transfer the USDC to our browser wallet, such as MetaMask
- Connect wallet to Harvest.finance
- Deposit USDC, receive fUSDC token, earn interest
- Stake fUSDC token, earn FARM

# Get Some Coinage :cucumber:
## Buy Some USDC
- First you need to get yourself some of that fresh USDC coinage. The easiest way is to probably exchange your local currency for it in an exchange. Exchanges, such as Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance, let you deposit currency via ACH, Wire Transfer, and even Debit Card. If you do ACH, your funds may be locked for a few days while waiting for the transfer to clear. I know, the FOMO is going to hurt!
- Once your funds are available, buy some USDC. You probably won't have to pay a fee for this exchange.
- Hooray, you now have some USDC to play with!

## Move USDC into Your Wallet
- To move crypto into Harvest.finance via the browser interface, you will need a browser Etherium wallet. MetaMask is one of the most popular ones out there.
- Go ahead and install the MetaMask extension on your Brave browser. You're using Brave, right? I thought you said you were into this whole blockchain thing!
- If you are using Brave, go into Brave Settings → Extensions → Web3 provider for using Dapps. Then select MetaMask (or whatever wallet you installed) from the dropdown.

- Follow instructions on your exchange and your wallet to transfer USDC from the exchange to the wallet. The flow would be something like this:
- On your Exchange, follow instructions to Send USDC
- For the recipient address, copy your Wallet's public address, and paste it into the recipient address on the Exchange Send page
- Click confirm…HOLD UP! Many exchanges will charge you Gas to Send crypto. We aren't going to go into the details here, but if they charge gas, you need to watch gas prices so you don't get hit with expensive transaction fees.

[//]: # (Should we add more info info on gas here? maybe a reference link or two?)
- Now wait patiently for your USDC to arrive in your wallet.
# Deposit USDC into the Farm to Earn More Coin! :carrot:
- Now the fun begins! Navigate to [harvest.finance](https://harvest.finance/) with a Desktop browser (doesn't work with mobile, sorry, not sorry).
- Click Connect Wallet.

- Your Wallet should ask you to approve connecting to harvest.finance. (yes, click Approve)
- Now you can send money into the harvest!

- Find USDC on the page. Here we can see the APY we'll earn on our deposit. Note: APY is not the same as APR. There are several articles on the interwebs covering this :smile:

- Either enter an amount or click Max. Then click deposit. Need screenshot
- Missing Steps to be filled in. Sorry :cry:

[//]: # (Missing some steps here. Need steps with screen shots)
- HOLD UP! Watch out for gas prices! Remember our little chat about gas prices earlier. Well, here they are again. Pay attention!
- After the transaction completed, you have now deposited USDC and receive an equivalent value of Farm tokenized USDC as fUSDC. Want to learn more about fUSDC and other f\<Assets>\? Check the FAQ!
- You can watch your balance \[mostly\] grow (remember the risk of Impermanent Loss?). You can see your balance to the right of the coin on the main page. Hopefully yours isn't blurred out like mine :laughing:.
