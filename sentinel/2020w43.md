# :tractor: Take Action

The farm is a busy place and there are always ways to help!

:dog: **[Test and improve](https://github.com/harvestfi/dashboard/pull/10)** this pull request to add web3modal support to the [Harvest Dashboard](https://harvestfi.github.io/dashboard/)! This will allow mobile wallets, and other supported wallets like [Gnosis Safe](https://blog.gnosis.pm/the-gnosis-safe-now-has-a-wallet-connect-integration-61000b098657), to connect to the dashboard and use Harvest All and other features. The current PR is a good start but needs additional logic to support and switch between Metamask and Walletconnect. There is a [web3modal example app](https://web3connect.com/) ([code](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal-vanilla-js-example/blob/master/example.js)) for inspiration.

:chicken: **[Create](https://www.publish0x.com/harvestfinance/announcing-harvestfinance-creativity-contest-round-2-plus-bo-xnldqpx)** for the Harvest Finance creativity contest! Any kind of art or web design is eligible. The contest features over $18k in prizes and runs until Wednesday, October 28th.

:pig: **[Vote](https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/pool-rotation-menu-of-the-week-week-44/883)** for the FARM:ETH pool on SushiSwap! No SUSHI is required to vote, just create an account on the SushiSwap forum. FARM holders will be able to deposit FARM:ETH SushiSwap LP tokens and receive SUSHI rewards. Harvest may also provide an autofarming pool with FARM rewards, though this has not been confirmed. While you are there, leave a comment in support of **keeping the WBTC-TBTC pool** that Harvest is [farming](https://harvest.finance/pool/fweth-sushi-wbtc-tbtc) as our first experiment with a SushiSwap pool. Providing liquidity on TBTC could create opportunities to collaborate with [Keep Network](https://keep.network/), creator of [TBTC](https://tbtc.network/), which may have more farming opportunies.

:cow: **[Vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuFBJXoM9Y9r3QJC79WX68ZFulJteb9uKqDnlDa96DXTcKUQ/viewform
)** and [comment on Twitter](https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1315819303703281664?s=20) to add Harvest fAssets to SnowSwap! fAssets are the Harvest yield-bearing assets that you receive when you deposit funds into the Harvest farming strategies. Creating liquidity for fAssets could make transactions less expensive to enter and exit Harvest vaults. Liquidity for fAssets can create more opportunities to integrate fAssets into other parts of the ecosystem, such as payments and lending.
