# :tractor: Take Action

The farm is a busy place and there are always ways to help!

:pig: **[Vote](https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/pool-rotation-menu-of-the-week-week-42/629)** for the WBTC:TBTC pool on SushiSwap! No SUSHI is required to vote, just create an account on the SushiSwap forum. If the pool does well in the vote, it will continue receiving SUSHI rewards. Harvest is [farming this pool](https://harvest.finance/pool/fweth-sushi-wbtc-tbtc) as our first experiment with a SushiSwap pool. Providing liquidity on TBTC could create opportunities to collaborate with [Keep Network](https://keep.network/), creator of [TBTC](https://tbtc.network/), which may have more farming opportunies.

:cow: **[Vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuFBJXoM9Y9r3QJC79WX68ZFulJteb9uKqDnlDa96DXTcKUQ/viewform
)** and [comment on Twitter](https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1315819303703281664?s=20) to add Harvest fAssets to SnowSwap! fAssets are the Harvest yield-bearing assets that you receive when you deposit funds into the Harvest farming strategies. Creating liquidity for fAssets could make transactions less expensive to enter and exit Harvest vaults. Liquidity for fAssets can create more opportunities to integrate fAssets into other parts of the ecosystem, such as payments and lending.

:chicken: **[Create](https://www.publish0x.com/harvestfinance/announcing-harvestfinance-creativity-contest-round-2-plus-bo-xnldqpx)** for the Harvest Finance creativity contest! Any kind of art or web design is eligible. The contest features over $18k in prizes and runs until Wednesday, October 28th.

# :sunflower: Listings

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Harvest was added to the [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/harvest-finance) leaderboard! Several community members contributed to the effort, making contact with the DeFi Pulse team, assisting with the copy for the listing, and submitting [code to calculate the Harvest TVL](https://github.com/harvestfi/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters/tree/c5544f8837de3c2021a360efddf241bba728ff0e/projects/harvest). Harvest debuted in 12th place with $272.65mm locked, in between SushiSwap and InstaDApp. Once Harvest's new UNI farming pools are accounted for, Harvest should move to 9th or 10th place between Yearn, RenVM, and Balancer.

:bank: No new [CEX or DEX listings](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harvest-finance#markets) that we are aware of. Trading volume is concentrated on the [Uniswap FARM:USDC pair](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x514906fc121c7878424a5c928cad1852cc545892), which has over $16mm in deposits and over $3mm in daily trading volume. No significant volume on other DEX according to [Etherscan DEX Tracker](https://etherscan.io/dextracker?a=&q=0xa0246c9032bc3a600820415ae600c6388619a14d) and [0x DEX Tracker](https://0xtracker.com/tokens/0xa0246c9032bc3a600820415ae600c6388619a14d).
