# Intro :corn:
Welcome back city slicker! Now that you roughed up your hands in the [first tutorial](/en/getting-started), let's start chasing some of that crazy APY in some other pools. How about the Uniswap Pool? That APY is way up there!

Sounds too good to be true, you say? Good point. You need to understand the risk if Impermanent Loss by playing in this pool.

> If you don't understand IL, I highly suggest you stop right here and do a little homework. Personally, I had to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0) 3 times, and read a few blog posts for it to finally sink in.

So you do want to live on the edge! Okay! Let's get going!
# Here's What We're Going to Do :tractor:
To participate in the Uniswap LP Farm, you will need to supply USDC-FARM liquidity to Uniswap's Liquidity Pool. Then use Uniswap LP tokens minted from that transaction to deposit into the Farm.
1. Get USDC (not sure how? Go to the previous tutorial)
1. Swap some of our USDC for FARM
1. Deposit USDC and FARM into Uniswap's Liquidity Pool. Receive UNI_LP tokens
1. Deposit UNI_LP Token into Farm
1. Profit! :bread:
# Get USDC :watermelon:
Alright, you should already know how to do this if you followed the first tutorial (link)
# Buy FARM :strawberry:
Now, with your USDC, you are going to swap it for farm
