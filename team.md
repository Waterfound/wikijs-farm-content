# Official Sites

The Harvest Finance project was launched by independent developers who wanted to make yield farming easier for smaller holders.

The official launch team information sources so far are Twitter, Medium, and chat on Discord:

- https://twitter.com/harvest_finance
- https://medium.com/harvest-finance
- https://discord.gg/R5SeTVR

Discord is the best place to discuss Harvest Finance and get help.

# Official Code

The Harvest Finance contracts are open source.

To prevent the proliferation of clones, the Harvest Finance website frontend is not currently open source.  This code may be opened later.
