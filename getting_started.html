<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome city boy! You aren't from around here, are ya? That's alright. We can use more hands on our farm. And soon you will be a seasoned farmer, just like the rest of us…with strong callused hands.</p>
<p>Before we get started, make sure you understand the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/press">basics</a> and the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/faq">risks</a> of farming.</p>
<p>All done? Alright! Let's get farming!</p>
<h1>What We're Gonna Do</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To help reduce the risk of impermanent loss (you read the risks, right?), we'll start with a stablecoin, USDC.</li>
  <li>We will buy USDC on an exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance</li>
  <li>Transfer the USDC to our browser wallet, such as MetaMask</li>
  <li>Connect wallet to Harvest.finance</li>
  <li>Deposit USDC, receive fUSDC token, earn interest</li>
  <li>Stake fUSDC token, earn FARM</li>
</ul>
<h1>Get Some Coinage</h1>
<h2>Buy Some USDC</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First you need to get yourself some of that fresh USDC coinage. The easiest way is to probably exchange your local currency for it in an exchange. Exchanges, such as Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance, let you deposit currency via ACH, Wire Transfer, and even Debit Card. If you do ACH, your funds may be locked for a few days while waiting for the transfer to clear. I know, the FOMO is going to hurt!</li>
  <li>Once your funds are available, buy some USDC. You probably won't have to pay a fee for this exchange.</li>
  <li>Hooray, you now have some USDC to play with!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Move USDC into Your Wallet</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To move crypto into Harvest.finance via the browser interface, you will need a browser Etherium wallet. MetaMask is one of the most popular ones out there.</li>
  <li>Go ahead and install the MetaMask extension on your Brave browser. You're using Brave, right? I thought you said you were into this whole blockchain thing!</li>
  <li>If you are using Brave, go into Brave Settings → Extensions → Web3 provider for using Dapps. Then select MetaMask (or whatever wallet you installed) from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:81.01%;"><img src="/getting_started_configure_brave_wallet.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Follow instructions on your exchange and your wallet to transfer USDC from the exchange to the wallet. The flow would be something like this:<ul>
      <li>On your Exchange, follow instructions to Send USDC</li>
      <li>For the recipient address, copy your Wallet's public address, and paste it into the recipient address on the Exchange Send page</li>
      <li>Click confirm….HOLD UP! Many exchanges will charge you Gas to Send crypto. We aren't going to go into the details here, but if they charge gas, you <strong>need</strong> to watch gas prices so you don't get hit with expensive transaction fees. <mark class="marker-yellow">Wonder if we should add more here?</mark></li>
      <li>Now wait patiently for your USDC to arrive in your wallet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Deposit USDC into the Farm to Earn More Coin!</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Now the fun begins! Navigate to <a href="https://harvest.finance/">harvest.finance</a> with a Desktop browser (doesn't work with mobile, sorry, not sorry).</li>
  <li>Click Connect Wallet.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:73.38%;"><img src="/getting_started_connect_wallet.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Your Wallet should ask you to approve connecting to harvest.finance. (yes, click Approve)</li>
  <li>Now you can send money into the harvest!</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/getting_started_configure_brave_wallet.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Find USDC on the page. Here we can see the APY we'll earn on our deposit. Note: APY is not the same as APR. There are several articles on the interwebs covering this :)</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/getting_started_usdc_apy2.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Either enter an amount or click Max. Then click deposit. <mark class="marker-yellow">Need screenshot</mark></li>
  <li><mark class="marker-yellow">Missing some steps here. Need steps with screen shots</mark></li>
  <li><strong>HOLD UP!</strong> Watch out for gas prices! Remember our little chat about gas prices earlier. Well, here they are again. Pay attention!</li>
  <li>After the transaction completed, you have now deposited USDC and receive an equivalent value of Farm tokenized USDC as fUSDC. Want to learn more about fUSDC and other f&lt;Assets&gt;? Check the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/faq">FAQ</a>!</li>
  <li>You can watch your balance [mostly] grow (remember the risk of Impermanent Loss?). You can see your balance to the right of the coin on the main page. Hopefully yours isn't blurred out like mine.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/getting_started_usdc_value.png"></figure>
<h1>Stake Your Tokens to Earn FARM</h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="/getting_started_did_you_say_steak.jpg">
  <figcaption>No, I said “stake"!</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li>Now you have all the fUSDC in your wallet. What on Earth are you to do with it??? Let's earn more APY…in FARM. You can find the APY here</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/getting_started_farm_apy.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>At the bottom of the page, you'll see a notice that you have unstaked fUSDC…. &nbsp;<mark class="marker-yellow">(need screenshot)</mark></li>
  <li><mark class="marker-yellow">need next steps here with screen shots</mark></li>
  <li><strong>HOLD UP!</strong> (what? again? YUP!) Watch out for gas prices! If you<strong> just</strong> did the previous transaction step and were happy with the price, keep going.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Watch your bounty grow</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Now just sit back and relax. It was good honest work for the day. You deserve a break, and just watch fruits (or bread) of your labor!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Harvest Finance Dashboard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click on that cute little farmer emoji at the top of the page</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:69.89%;"><img src="/getting_started_farmer_emoji_menu.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>You can also navigate directly to the page here: <a href="https://harvestfi.github.io/dashboard/">https://harvestfi.github.io/dashboard/</a></li>
  <li>Follow the steps to connect your wallet, just like you did on harvest.finance. And here's your dashboard! Let's walk through what you see here.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:74.28%;"><img src="/getting_started_harvest_finance_dashboard2.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your wallet address</strong>: That's right city slicker! That's your wallet address. Click on it to see it in Etherscan</li>
  <li><strong>Pool</strong>: Which liquidity pool (LP) you are in. Since we used USDC in this example, that's what we see here</li>
  <li><strong>Earning</strong>: This better say “true”. <mark class="marker-yellow">When would this say false?</mark></li>
  <li><strong>Staked Balance</strong>: How much fUSDC you staked. This matches the "Your Staked fUSDC" on the Earn Page of Harvest.finance</li>
  <li><strong>Earned Rewards</strong>: How much FARM you earned. This matches the “Total FARM Earned” on the Earn page</li>
  <li><strong>% of Pool</strong>: The percentage of the USDC Farm pool that is your stake</li>
  <li><strong>USD Value</strong>: This is the total value of your fUSDC and FARM combined</li>
  <li><strong>Unstaked Balance</strong>: If you have any fUSDC that is not staked, you'll see it here.</li>
  <li><strong>Your staked assets and earned rewards are worth about</strong>: If you are staked in multiple Farms, this is the total of the “USD Values” for each Pool.</li>
  <li><strong>Underlying Balance</strong>: If you were to Unstake your fUSDC, then Withdraw, this is how much USDC you would get for your fUSDC.</li>
  <li><strong>Please consider donating</strong>: Farming is good honest work. So is building apps to support it. Toss a coin to your developer.</li>
</ul>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">Greenhorn Q&amp;A</mark></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Where does all this great APY come from? Whose money was it?</li>
  <li>Why does my balance go up and down?</li>
  <li>Why does the APY go up and down?</li>
  <li>Everyone keeps talking about “Whales” in the Discord. What are they, and how do they impact farming?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Wiki notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Need help with all highlighted areas, please :)</li>
  <li>I want to include more images of the transactions, but I have nothing to transact to take screen shots :/</li>
  <li>Should we talk more about gas prices? This hit me right in the n00bs when I first started. At least need a couple good links to help explain it?</li>
  <li>Need some A's for the Q's on the Greenhorn Q&amp;A.</li>
  <li>Please delete images from the image pool (I don't have permission). These images are not needed anymore: <strong>getting_started_coinbase_portfolio.png, getting_started_usdc_value2.png, getting_started_usdc_apy.png, getting_started_harvest_finance_dashboard.png</strong></li>
