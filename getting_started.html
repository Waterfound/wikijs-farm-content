<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome city boy! You aren't from around here, are ya? That's alright. We can use more hands on our farm. And soon you will be a seasoned farmer, just like the rest of us…with strong callused hands.</p>
<p>Before we get started, make sure you understand the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/press">basics</a> and the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/faq">risks</a> of farming.</p>
<p>All done? Alright! Let's get farming!</p>
<h1>What We're Gonna Do</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To help reduce the risk of impermanent loss (you read the risks, right?), we'll start with a stablecoin, USDC.</li>
  <li>We will buy USDC on an exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance</li>
  <li>Transfer the USDC to our browser wallet. We'll use MetaMask</li>
  <li>Connect Metamask to Harvest.finance</li>
  <li>Deposit USDC, receive fUSDC token, earn interest</li>
  <li>Stake fUSDC token, earn FARM</li>
</ul>
<h1>Get Some Coinage</h1>
<h2>Buy Some USDC</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First you need to get yourself some of that fresh USDC coinage. The easiest way is to probably exchange your local currency for it in an exchange. Exchanges, such as Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance, let you deposit currency via ACH, Wire Transfer, and even Debit Card. If you do ACH, your funds may be locked for a few days while waiting for the transfer to clear. I know, the FOMO is going to hurt!</li>
  <li>Once your funds are available, buy some USDC. You probably won't have to pay a fee for this exchange.</li>
  <li>Hooray, you now have some USDC to play with!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Move USDC into Your Wallet</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To move crypto into Harvest.finance via the browser interface, you will need a browser Etherium wallet. MetaMask is one of the most popular ones out there.</li>
  <li>Go ahead and install the MetaMask extension on your Brave browser. You're using Brave, right? I thought you said you were into this whole blockchain thing!</li>
  <li>Follow instructions on your exchange and your wallet to transfer USDC from the exchange to the wallet. The flow would be something like this:<ul>
      <li>On your Exchange, follow instructions to Send USDC</li>
      <li>For the recipient address, copy your Wallet's public address, and paste it into the recipient address on the Exchange Send page</li>
      <li>Click confirm….HOLD UP! Many exchanges will charge you Gas to Send crypto. We aren't going to go into the details here, but if they charge gas, you <strong>need</strong> to watch gas prices so you don't get hit with expensive transaction fees. <mark class="marker-yellow">Wonder if we should add more here?</mark></li>
      <li>Now wait patiently for your USDC to arrive in your wallet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Deposit USDC into the Farm to Earn More Coin!</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Now the fun begins! Navigate to <a href="https://harvest.finance/">harvest.finance</a> with a Desktop browser (doesn't work with mobile, sorry, not sorry).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click Connect Wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch out for gas prices!</p>
<h1>Stake your tokens to earn Farm</h1>
<p>Will need someone with unstaked fUSDC to take screen shots.</p>
<p>Watch out for gas prices!</p>
<h1>Watch your bounty grow</h1>
<p>Front page and the dashboard</p>
<h1>Wiki notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Should we talk more about gas prices? This hit me right in the n00bs when I first started. At least need a couple good links to help explain it?</li>
  <li>I want to include more images of the transactions, but I have nothing to transact to take screen shots :/</li>
  <li>Please delete this image from the image pool: <strong>getting_started_coinbase_portfolio.png</strong></li>
</ul>
