<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome city boy! You aren't from around here, are ya? That's alright. We can use more hands on our farm. And soon you will be a seasoned farmer, just like the rest of usâ€¦with strong callused hands.</p>
<p>Before we get started, make sure you understand the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/press">basics</a> and the <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/faq">risks</a> of farming.</p>
<p>All done? Alright! Let's get farming!</p>
<h1>What We're Gonna Do</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To help reduce the risk of impermanent loss (you read the risks, right?), we'll start with a stablecoin, USDC.</li>
  <li>We will buy USDC on an exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance</li>
  <li>Transfer the USDC to our browser wallet. We'll use MetaMask</li>
  <li>Connect Metamask to Harvest.finance</li>
  <li>Deposit USDC, receive fUSDC token, earn interest</li>
  <li>Stake fUSDC token, earn FARM</li>
</ul>
<h1>Get Some Coinage</h1>
<h2>Buy Some USDC</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First you need to get yourself some of that fresh USDC coinage. The easiest way is to probably exchange your local currency for it in an exchange. Exchanges, such as Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance, let you deposit currency via ACH, Wire Transfer, and even Debit Card. If you do ACH, your funds may be locked for a few days while waiting for the transfer to clear. I know, the FOMO is going to hurt!</li>
  <li>Once your funds are available, buy some USDC. You probably won't have to pay a fee for this exchange.</li>
  <li>Hooray, you now have some USDC to play with!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Move USDC into Your Wallet</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To move crypto into Harvest.finance via the browser interface, you will need a browser Etherium wallet. Metamask is one of the most popular ones out there.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Connecting Your Wallet</h1>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Deposit your coin into the Farm to earn more coin</h1>
<p>Will need someone with USDC in their wallet to take screen shots.</p>
<p>Watch out for gas prices!</p>
<h1>Stake your tokens to earn Farm</h1>
<p>Will need someone with unstaked fUSDC to take screen shots.</p>
<p>Watch out for gas prices!</p>
