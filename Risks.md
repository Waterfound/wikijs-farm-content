Depositing your funds doesn’t come without its fair share of risk. In this article we will explore the general risks of Impermanent Loss, Slippage, Contract risks, Composability and Price volatility. We will also explore the risks associated with the current Harvest strategies*. It is important to understand that this article is not created by a licensed financial expert. So, please, Do Your Own Research and never invest more than you can lose. 
*Strategies are changed often as to provide best return for our farmers, so always check https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/strategy for latest updates.


**Smart Contract**
As a principle smarts contracts are a piece of code and it is possible that they include bugs or malicious code. Harvest Finance have commissioned 3 top notch security companies to audit our smart contract. While we are still waiting for full audits, we have a preliminary confirmation stating that there are no serious business logic issues (LINK https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1303012731197382656?s=20). Check the ContractsPage for more information on who is commissioned and deadlines. 
However, security audits don’t eliminate risks completely.

Why is this relevant for me?
Harvest Finance uses smart contracts to produce yield for our farmers. 

Composability 
Composability risk is about leveraging other smart contracts and accruing their risks. Harvest Finance as an aggregator is using other contracts for functionality and to increase yields. Look into current strategy employed to get to know what other contracts are leveraged.

**Impermanent Loss / Divergence loss**

Impermanent loss is associated with providing funds/coins to a liquidity pool. Liquidity pools are used in Decentralized Exchanges such as Uniswap, Curve and Balancer in order to create money markets a.k.a. the ability for traders to buy and sell coins. 
Impermanent loss can be easily explained by the difference in holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that asset. Or simply said you might be better off by holding an asset vs providing liquidity for it on a Decentralized Exchange. For example, in Uniswap a 25% price change of an asset results in a 0.6% loss relative to if you hold the asset. There are very good resources to understand the concept and the math behind it – HERE(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0) and HERE(https://medium.com/@pintail/uniswap-a-good-deal-for-liquidity-providers-104c0b6816f2). 


Why is this relevant for me farming with Harvest Finance?
Harvest uses strategies that have exposure to liquidity pools, thus it is susceptible to this kind of risk.

**Slippage**
Slippage occurs when funds are initially bought on a decentralized exchange. Sometimes 
IT IS VERY OFTEN THAT WILL LOSE A TINY % of their funds initially due to slipage
