# Harvest Finance Brings #BreadToThePeople :bread:

Yield farming can offer high interest rates, but it is becoming hard for smaller farmers to access:

:corn: Tracking and responding to yield farming opportunities can be a full-time job.

:carrot: Gas costs are increasing, and moving between farming opportunities is becoming prohibitively expensive.

:tomato: Smart contracts are hard to audit and bugs can result in locked funds for theft.

Harvest addresses this by deploying strategies to move assets between different yield farming opportunities to maximize yield. Deposit into Harvest and Harvest takes care of APY tracking, strategy development and auditing, and gas costs.
