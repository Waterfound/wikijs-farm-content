# Harvest Finance Brings #BreadToThePeople :bread:

Yield farming can offer high interest rates, but it is becoming hard for smaller farmers to access:

:corn: Tracking and responding to yield farming opportunities can be a full-time job.

:carrot: Gas costs are increasing. Moving between farming opportunities and regularly transacting to compound your yields is becoming prohibitively expensive.

:tomato: Smart contracts are hard to audit and bugs can result in lost funds.

Harvest addresses this by deploying strategies to move assets between different yield farming opportunities to maximize yield. **Deposit into Harvest and Harvest takes care of APY tracking, strategy development and auditing, and gas costs.** Deposits are automatically compounded wherever possible to maximize yield.
