>There is currently an error with the WETH contract due to an oversight by the CREAM contracts. WETH was not lost. The issue is being resolved by the CREAM team. At the present time, please do not try to withdraw your wETH from stakes, as it will likely be lost.{.is-danger}

# Harvest Finance Brings #BreadToThePeople :bread:

Yield farming can offer high interest rates, but it is becoming hard for smaller farmers to access:

:corn: Tracking and responding to yield farming opportunities can be a full-time job.

:carrot: Gas costs are increasing, and moving between farming opportunities is becoming prohibitively expensive.

:tomato: Smart contracts are hard to audit and bugs can result in locked funds for theft.

Harvest addresses this by deploying strategies to move assets between different yield farming opportunities to maximize yield. Deposit into Harvest and Harvest takes care of APY tracking, strategy development and auditing, and gas costs.
