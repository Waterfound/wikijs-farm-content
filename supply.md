While there is no premine, some tokens of the tokens will be vested and released to incentivize further development:

- 20% of the FARM tokens will vest to the development team
- 10% of the FARM tokens will vest to the Farm Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion
- 70% of the tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers on automated market makers (AMMs) like Unsiwap

# What do FARM tokens do?

Funds in Harvest Finance are use to participate in yield farming.  5% of the revenue from the yield farming operations will be distributed to FARM tokenholders.


FARM tokens also allow for participation in [Harvest Finance governance](/govern).
