# How Many FARM tokens are there?

The $FARM token first became available when Harvest Finance launched on September 1st, 2020.

There will be a maximum of [5,000,000 FARM distributed over four years][medium-launch], but the final distribution may be substantially less. Already, 14,850 $FARM has been burned.

The initial distribution plan intended that only ~4% of the FARM supply would become available in the first month after launch. However, in Week 3 the team began burning 36% of emissions to reduce the $FARM inflation rate.

Burn transactions, week 3:

# How are the tokens distributed?

FARM is bootstrapped and has no VCs or investors.

While there is no premine, some tokens of the tokens will be vested and released to incentivize further development:

- 70% of the FARM tokens will be distributed to capital and liquidity providers
- 10% of the FARM tokens will vest to the Operational Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion
- 20% of the FARM tokens will vest to the Development Team
