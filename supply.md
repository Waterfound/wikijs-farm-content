# How are the tokens distributed?

FARM is bootstrapped and has no VCs or investors.

While there is no premine, some tokens of the tokens will be vested and released to incentivize further development:

- 70% of the FARM tokens will be distributed to capital and liquidity providers
- 10% of the FARM tokens will vest to the Operational Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion
- 20% of the FARM tokens will vest to the Development Team

# What do FARM tokens do?

- Farm Token is the governance token for Harvest. 
- Farm holders can vote on proposals for the Opeartional Treasury. 
- Farm holders receive 30% of profits generated by the LPs when they stake $FARM in the Profit Share pool. (https://harvest.finance/pool/profit-sharing-farm) The profits are converted to USDC and used to market buy in masse the $FARM token, which are then sent to the Profit Share to be distributed proportionally to anyone staking $FARM tokens. Not only can you compound the $FARM tokens earned here, the $FARM earned in the fAsset staking pools can be compounded here. *Directly speaking, the value of $FARM comes from the profits generated in the various deployed strategies.* The more people who deposit funds on the front page with Harvest Finance means more profits generated by the platform, which means more $$$ for those staking $FARM. It is also EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to understand the $FARM paid by the Profit Share is market bought, and not artificially stimulated profits by token emissions.

# How did FARM tokens change from 5M to 690K
Originally there were total supply of 5 million FARM tokens. But the community wanted to cut the total number of supply. So there was a governanace poll on September 27, 2020 to decide how much supply it should be. The options were 1 million or 690k. The result were 690k total supply.
