# Contract Tests

Harvest's talented tractor engineers have created one of the best test suites, learn more [here](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/tree/master/test)

The contracts also have extensive comments to understand what each part of the code is doing.


# Contract Audits

To keep the crops secure, you must invest in fences. The Harvest operations budget (10% of supply) will be used to ensure that Harvest farming strategies are audited and secure.

## PeckShield Audit

Currently, the chickens from Peckshield have offered to peck the contracts to ensure all the harvesters have no oil leakage.

Last few days PeckShield has done a sanity check of Harvest Finance smart contracts, so far no serious business logic issue was found.  In the next several weeks, we will conduct a full security audit of the smart contracts. [@harvest_finance](https://twitter.com/harvest_finance) #DeFiFarming
