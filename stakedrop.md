# Stake Tokens, Earn FARM

To participate and earn FARM, stake one of several supported assets to receive a share of FARM distributed in the first four years after Harvest Finance launches:

- [Harvest Finance launch announcement](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/the-harvest-finance-project-338c3e5806fc)
- staking started: September 1st, 2020
- staking ends: September 1st, 2024
- [FARM token supply information](/supply)

Wave1 staking can be managed in several places:

- Official launch site: https://harvest.finance/
- Independent third-party sites
- Directly on Etherscan contracts

> Staking from Etherscan required first setting an allowance from the staked token to the corresponding stake pool
