# Contribute with the Wiki UI

Contributing is easy!  Create and edit pages within seconds by signing in with the accounts you already have on supported services:

1. Click on `sign in` in the top right-hand corner
2. Select what kind of account you'd like to sign in with. The wiki currently supports GitHub; Discord and others may be added soon.
3. Start contributing!  Create new pages and edit existing ones.

Some changes to the site, like adding your new page to the navigation sidebar, will require help from a wiki manager. Post in the `#wiki` channel on Discord for assistance.

> Please use the Markdown format to create new pages.

# Contribute with GitHub

The contents of the wiki are automatically synchronized with this repository in GitHub: https://github.com/chainwikinet/wikijs-farm-content

Sign up for a GitHub account.  Then, use the GitHub UI to propose changes to the content.  When you are satisfied with your changes, submit a "pull request" to request that your changes are merged into the wiki.

After your pull request is approved by a wiki manager, they should go live on the wiki within a few minutes.
